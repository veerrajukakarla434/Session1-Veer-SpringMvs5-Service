#### Web Application :
* A web application is a computer program that utilizes web browsers and web technology to perform tasks over the Internet.

#### Here's what a typical web application flow looks like:

1)  **User** triggers a request to the **web server** over the **Internet,** either through a web browser or the application’s user interface

2)  **Web server** forwards this request to the appropriate **web application server**

3)  **Web application server** performs the requested task – such as querying the **database** or processing the data – then generates the results of the requested data

4)  **Web application server** sends results to the web server with the requested information or processed data

5)  **Web server** responds back to the client with the requested information that then appears on the user’s display
